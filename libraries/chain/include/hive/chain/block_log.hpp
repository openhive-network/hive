  /* The block log is an external append only log of the blocks. Blocks should only be written
    * to the log after they irreverisble as the log is append only. The log is a doubly linked
    * list of blocks. There is a secondary index file of only block positions that enables O(1)
    * random access lookup by block number.
    *
    * +---------+----------------+---------+----------------+-----+------------+-------------------+
    * | Block 1 | Pos of Block 1 | Block 2 | Pos of Block 2 | ... | Head Block | Pos of Head Block |
    * +---------+----------------+---------+----------------+-----+------------+-------------------+
    *
    * +----------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+
    * | Pos of Block 1 | Pos of Block 2 | ... | Pos of Head Block |
    * +----------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+
    *
    * The block log can be walked in order by deserializing a block, skipping 8 bytes, deserializing a
    * block, repeat... The head block of the file can be found by seeking to the position contained
    * in the last 8 bytes the file. The block log can be read backwards by jumping back 8 bytes, following
    * the position, reading the block, jumping back 8 bytes, etc.
    *
    * Blocks can be accessed at random via block number through the index file. Seek to 8 * (block_num - 1)
    * to find the position of the block in the main file.
    *
    * The main file is the only file that needs to persist. The index file can be reconstructed during a
    * linear scan of the main file.
