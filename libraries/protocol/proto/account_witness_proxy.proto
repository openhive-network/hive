/* A user may vote for a witness or proposal directly (using an operation: account_witness_vote_operation or update_proposal_votes_operation)
 * or indirectly (using the proxy - operation:  account_witness_proxy_operation).
 * If a user sets a proxy, the witness votes are removed and the proposal votes are deactivated.
 * If a user removes a proxy, there are no witness votes and the proposal votes are activated.
 * Settings proxy means that a user wants to cede a decision on which witnesses to vote for to an account indicated as {proxy}. 
 * {proxy} will also vote for proposals in the name of {account}.

 * in HIVE_GOVERNANCE_VOTE_EXPIRATION_PERIOD, the votes are removed and the virtual operation:
 * expired_account_notification_operation is generated.
 * If the proxy was set and now it is removed, the additionally the virtual operation: proxy_cleared_operation is generated.
