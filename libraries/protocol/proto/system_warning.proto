/* Related to block processing or selected operations.
 * Generated every time something occurs that would normally be only visible to node operators in their logs
 * but might be interesting to general HIVE community. Such vops can be observed on account history of 'initminer'.
 * Currently the following generate system warnings:
 *  - unknown type of witness during block processing [should probably be FC_ASSERT]
 *    indicates some problem in the code
 *  - shortfall of collateral during finalization of HIVE->HBD conversion (@see fill_collateralized_convert_request_operation)
 *    the community covers the difference in form of tiny amount of extra inflation
 *  - artificial correction of internal price of HIVE due to hitting of HBD hard cap limit
 *    every operation that involves conversion from HBD to HIVE will give output amount that is smaller than real world value
 *  - noncanonical fee symbol used by witness [should disappear if it never happened as suggested by TODO message]
 *  - witnesses changed maximum block size
