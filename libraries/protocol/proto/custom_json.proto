/* The operation custom_json_operation works similar as custom_operation,
 * but it is designed to be human readable/developer friendly.
 * The custom_json_operation is larger than custom_operation or custom_binary, that is why it costs more RC.
 * It should be signed as required in { required_auths } or { required_posting_auths }. 
 * The examples of custom_json_operation:
 * - reblog
 * - muted
 * - pinned
 * - follow
 *
 * @param {string} required_auths
 * @param {string} required_posting_auths
 * @param {string} id - Must be less than 32 characters long.
 * @param {string} json - Must be a proper utf8 JSON string.
