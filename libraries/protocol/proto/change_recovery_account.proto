/* The operation change_recovery_account_operation allows a user to update their recovery account.
 * It is important to keep it actual, because only a recovery account may create a request
 * account recovery in case of compromised the owner authority.
 * By default the recovery account is set to the account creator or it is empty if it was created by temp account or mined.
 * In order to cancel the change_recovery_account_operation, the operation change_recovery_account_operation,
 * the operation should be created with {new_recovery_account} set to the old one.
 * The operation is done with a 30 days (HIVE_OWNER_AUTH_RECOVERY_PERIOD) delay.
 *
