/* A user may vote for proposals directly using an operation: update_proposal_votes_operation,
 * or indirectly using the proxy - operation:  account_witness_proxy_operation.
 * A user may vote for proposals submitted by the other users.
 * By voting for the proposal, a user may select which proposals should be funded.
 * A user may vote for as many proposals as they wants, but you cannot vote twice for the same proposal.
 * If a proxy is specified then all existing votes are deactivated. When the proxy is removed, the votes will be activated.
 * Your vote power depends on your HP.
 * If the operation account_witness_vote_operation or account_witness_proxy_operation or update_proposal_votes_operation
 * is not executed in HIVE_GOVERNANCE_VOTE_EXPIRATION_PERIOD, the votes are removed and the virtual operation:
 * expired_account_notification_operation is generated.
