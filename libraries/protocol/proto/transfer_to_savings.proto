/* A user can place Hive and Hive Dollars into savings balances.
 * Funds can be withdrawn from these balances after a three day delay.
 * Keeping funds on the savings balance mitigates loss from hacked and compromised accounts.
 * The maximum amount a user can lose instantaneously is the sum of what they hold in liquid balances.
 * Assuming an account can be recovered quickly, loss in such situations can be kept to a minimum
 * Additionally for keeping Hive Dollars on the savings balance, the interests are calculated.
