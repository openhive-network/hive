/* The operation delegate_vesting_shares_operation allows to delegate an amount
 * of { vesting_shares } to an { delegatee } account. The { vesting_shares } are still owned by { delegator },
 * but the voting rights and resource credit are transferred.
 * A user may not delegate:
 * - the vesting shares that are already delegated
 * - the delegated vesting shares to him (a user does not own them)
 * - the vesting shares in the Power down process
 * - the already used voting shares for voting or downvoting
 * In order to remove the vesting shares delegation, the operation delegate_vesting_shares_operation
 * should be created with {vesting_shares = 0}. When a delegation is removed, the delegated vesting shares
 * are frozen for five days (HIVE_DELEGATION_RETURN_PERIOD_HF20) to prevent voting twice.
 *
 * @param {string} delegator - The account delegating vesting shares.
 * @param {string} delegatee - The account receiving vesting shares.
 * @param {asset} vesting_shares - The amount of vesting shares to be delegated.
 *                                 Minimal amount = 1/3 of the fee for creating a new account.
