/* Creates/updates/removes a recurrent transfer in the currency Hive or HBD.
 * Since HF 28, if user has more than one recurrent transfer to the same receiver
 * or if user creates the recurrent transfer using pair_id in the extensions,
 * user has to specify the pair_id in order to update or remove the defined recurrent transfer. 
 * - If amount is set to 0, the recurrent transfer will be deleted and the virtual operation
 *   fill_recurrent_transfer_operation is not generated
 * - If there is already a recurrent transfer matching 'from' and 'to', the recurrent transfer will be replaced, but:
 * - If the 'recurrence' is not changed, the next execution will be according to “old definition” 
 * - If the 'recurrence' is changed, then the next execution will be “update date” + 'recurrence' there is no execution on the update date. 
 * - Up to HF28 there can be only one recurrent transfer for sender 'from' and receiver 'to'.
 *   Since H28 users may define more recurrent transfers to the same sender and receiver using pair_id in the 'executions'.
 * - The one account may define up to 255 recurrent transfers to other accounts. 
 * - The execution date of the last transfer should be no more than 730 days in the future.
