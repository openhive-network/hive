/* A user may vote for a witness directly using an operation:
 * account_witness_vote_operation or indirectly using the proxy - operation:  account_witness_proxy_operation.
 * All accounts with a Hive Power (also called Vesting Fund Shares or VESTS) can vote for up to 30 witnesses,
 * but you cannot vote twice for the same witnesses. 
 * If a proxy is specified then all existing votes are removed.
 * Your vote power depends on your HP.
 * If the operation account_witness_vote_operation or account_witness_proxy_operation or update_proposal_votes_operation
 * is not executed in a HIVE_GOVERNANCE_VOTE_EXPIRATION_PERIOD, the votes are removed and the virtual operation:
 * expired_account_notification_operation is generated.
