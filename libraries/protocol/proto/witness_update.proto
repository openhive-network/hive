/* The operation witness_update_operation may be used to become a new witness or to update witness properties.
 * There are two operations that allow to update witness properties witness_update_operation and witness_set_properties_operation.
 * In order to update witness properties it is recommended to use witness_set_properties_operation.
 *
 * If a user wants to become a witness, the operation witness_update_operation should be created.
 * If the witness doesnâ€™t want to be a witness any more, the operation witness_update_operation with empty { block_signing_key }
 * should be created.
 *
 * @param {string} owner - The witness who wants to update properties or a user who wants to become a witness.
 * @param {string} url - url to information about witness.
 * @param {string} block_signing_key - Public block signing key.
 * @param {legacy_chain_properties} props
 * @param {asset} fee - The asset is validated (the format should be correct and should be expressed in Hive),
 *                      but the fee is currently ignored.
