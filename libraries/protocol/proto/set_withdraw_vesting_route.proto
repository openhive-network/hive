/* The operation set_withdraw_vesting_route_operation allows a user to decide where
 * and how much percent of hive should be transferred to  the account { to_account }
 * from power down operation. A user may also decide that the Hive may be immediately converted to Hive Power.
 * The operation may be created in any moment of power down operation and even if there is no power down operation in progress.
 * The setting is valid till a user creates an operation  set_withdraw_vesting_route_operation
 * with the same { to_account} and with the {percent} = 0.
 * A user may set up 10 { to_account } accounts.
