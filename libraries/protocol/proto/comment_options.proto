/* The operation comment_options_operation allows to set properties regarding payouts,
 * rewards or beneficiaries (using {extensions}) for comments.
 * If the operation: comment_options_operation is done by one of the frontends,
 * it is usually in the same transaction with the operation: comment_operation.
 * If a comment has received any votes, only the parameter {percent_hbd} may be changed.
 *
 * @param {string} author - Account name, the author of the comment.
 * @param {string} permlink - The identifier of the comment.
 * @param {asset} max_accepted_payout - The maximum value of payout in HBD.
 *                                      Default value: max_accepted_payout = asset( 1000000000, HBD_SYMBOL ).
 *                                      The allowed value should be less than the default value.
 *                                      If max_accepted_payout = 0, then voters and authors will not receive the payout.
 * @param {number} percent_hbd - By default the author reward is paid 50% HP and 50 % HBD.
 *                               In some rare situations, instead of HBD, the Hive may be paid.
 *                               percent_hbd = HIVE_100_PERCENT means that 100 % of HBD part is paid in HBD.
 *                               A user may decide how many percent of HBD (from 50 %) they wants to receive in the HBD,
 *                               the rest will be paid out in HP.
 *                               Default value: percent_hbd = HIVE_100_PERCENT.
 *                               The allowed value should be less than the default value.
 *                               This is the only parameter that can be modified after the comment receives any vote.
 * @param {bool} allow_votes - The flag that allows to decide whether the comment may receive a vote.
 *                             Default value: allow_votes = true.
 * @param {bool} allow_curation_rewards - The flag that allows to decide whether the voters for the comment should
 *                                        receive the curation rewards. Rewards return to the reward fund.
 *                                        Default value: allow_curation_rewards = true.
 * @param {comment_payout_beneficiaries} extensions - It may contain the list of the beneficiaries,
 *                                                    the accounts that should receive the author reward.
 *                                                    The list consists of the account name and the weight of the shares in the author reward.
 *                                                    If the sum of the weights is less than 100%,
 *                                                    the rest of the reward is received by the author.
 *                                                    It should be defined less than 128 accounts.
 *                                                    The allowed range of the weight is from 0 to 10000 (0 â€“ 100%).
 *                                                    The beneficiaries should be listed in alphabetical order, no duplicates.
