/* This operation converts Hive Power (also called Vesting Fund Shares or VESTS) into HIVE.
 * At any given point in time an account can be withdrawing from their vesting shares.
 * A user may change the number of shares they wish to cash out at any time between 0 and their total vesting stake.
 * After applying this operation, vesting_shares will be withdrawn at a rate of vesting_shares/13 per week for 13 weeks
 * starting one week after this operation is included in the blockchain.
 * This operation is not valid if a user has no vesting shares.
 * There can be only one withdraw_vesting_operation  processed at the same time.
 * If a user wants to stop withdraw_vesting_operation, they should create an operation withdraw_vesting_operation with amount =0.
 * If a user creates a new withdraw_vesting_operation when the old one is still processed,
 * then the old withdraw_vesting_operation will be canceled and a new one will be processed.
