/* Operations account_update_operation and account_update2_operation share a limit of allowed updates of the owner authority:
 * two executions per 60 minutes (HIVE_OWNER_UPDATE_LIMIT) (meaning each of them can be executed twice or both can be executed once during that time period).
 * After 30 days (HIVE_OWNER_AUTH_RECOVERY_PERIOD) using the account recovery process to change the owner authority is no longer possible.
 * The operation account_update_operation allows changing authorities, it doesn’t allow changing the posting_json_metadata.
