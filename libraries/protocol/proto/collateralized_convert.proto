 * The operation is performed after 3.5 days, but the owner gets HBD immediately.
 * The price risk is cushioned by extra HIVE (HIVE_COLLATERAL_RATIO = 200 % ).
 * After actual conversion takes place the excess HIVE is returned to the owner.

 * @param {number} requestid - The number is given by a user. Should be unique for a user.
 * @param {asset} amount - Amount > 0, have to be in Hive.
