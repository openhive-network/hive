/* Similar to convert_operation, this operation instructs the blockchain to convert HIVE to HBD.
 * The operation is performed after 3.5 days, but the owner gets HBD immediately.
 * The price risk is cushioned by extra HIVE (HIVE_COLLATERAL_RATIO = 200 % ).
 * After actual conversion takes place the excess HIVE is returned to the owner.
 *
 * Description https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/blob/develop/doc/devs/operations/48_collateralized_convert.md?ref_type=heads
