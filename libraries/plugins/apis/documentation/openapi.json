        "description": "**Introduction to Hive**\n\nHive is an advanced decentralized blockchain offering fast, fee-less transactions completed in just 3 seconds. It's highlighted by features like human-readable account names, a decentralized community fund, and an algorithmic stablecoin, HBD, backed by HIVE.\n\nPowered by the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, Hive achieves an optimal blend of scalability, decentralization, and speed. \n\n**Innovative Features:**\n\n- **Resource Credits System:** Users can stake HIVE tokens to gain resources, enabling virtually free transactions directly on the blockchain, avoiding high fees common with Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n- **Human Readable Usernames:** Simplifies interactions by allowing easy recollection of account names for both businesses and individuals, enhancing social and financial interactions.\n\n- **Algorithmic Stablecoin:** The HBD stablecoin, backed by HIVE, boasts nearly a decade of stable performance, being among the pioneers of algorithmic stablecoins.\n\n- **Social Networking:** Hive's flagship applications are decentralized, community-driven social networks, establishing it as the first blockchain to truly support free speech and decentralized information sharing within the Web3 space.\n\n- **Decentralized Hive Fund:** Managed and owned by the community, this fund allocates resources to global developers and teams fostering innovation on the blockchain.\n\n- **Applications in Gaming, NFT, DeFi, and More:** Hive offers an attractive development environment with seamless integration capabilities for building engaging Web3 applications.\n\n**Web2 vs Web3**\n\nWhile today's Internet (Web2) is dominated by services that exchange personal data for functionality, Web3, powered by blockchains like Hive, enables decentralized applications (dApps) that respect data ownership and empower users.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n| Aspect          | Web2                                        | Web3                                           |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Ownership  | Centralized entities control data           | Decentralized, user-owned data                 |\n| Trust           | Requires trust in central authorities       | Trustless with blockchain technology           |\n| Censorship      | Susceptible to centralized censorship       | Decentralization provides resistance           |\n| Scalability     | Limited by central infrastructure           | Potentially expansive through decentralization |\n| Transparency    | Opaque data handling processes              | Blockchain offers transparent records          |\n| Governance      | Centralized power structures                | DAO-based, community governance                |\n| Monetization    | Relies on advertising, central monetization | Tokens and smart contracts decentralize it     |\n| Intermediaries  | Heavily depends on middlemen                | Reduced need for intermediaries                |\n| Innovation      | Driven by major corporations                | Community and protocol-driven                  |\n\nInvest your time in building innovative Web3 products with Hive's empowering platform.\n\n**Developer Workflow**\n\nThis overview provides a simplified understanding of how services interact with the blockchain. It serves as a foundation for learning and developing within the Hive network.\n"

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote.

Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive?

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

The years of distribution issues and reliance on a central entity for code and infrastructure has been at the heart of a revolution of sorts, and the new Hive blockchain is the culmination of stepping up to meet the challenge of returning to shared values of protecting and celebrating the vibrant community that has grown around our ecosystem.\n\n# Check out the FAQ below for info on the launch of Hive.\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n## What is Hive and why was it created?\n\n**Hive is a DPOS governance blockchain created by implementing a hard fork of existing Steem code.**\n\nThe intention of this community-driven fork is to support and build on the strong Steem community values that have made our ecosystem so diverse and exciting. This new direction steps away from the burden of the Steemit Inc. ninja-mined stake, which has impacted the long term ability to work towards further development and decentralization for years.\n\nHive has begun with a talented and committed team of community developers who are already paving the way to implement much awaited improvements and robust new developments to the blockchain. It is exciting to see the community – from devs and business owners to passionate end users – stepping forward to embrace and contribute to the potential of Hive. This renewed spirit, combined with a renewed codebase and a focus on working more closely with the entire ecosystem, is key to the success and possibilities for the future of social blockchain.\n<br>\n\n## What is the difference between Hive and Steem?\nHive is a fork of the Steem blockchain and runs completely independently from the existing chain.  All valid accounts on the Steem blockchain will receive an airdrop on Hive. *(more details below)*\n\nWhile the Hive chain is a fork of the Steem code, the intention is to take responsibility to build something even better. The initial Hive launch will be a direct copy of existing blockchain with a few small upgrades, which will allow us to get back to community discussion on the direction for future development, needed changes, and most wanted chain-level features. \n\nThe spirit of Steem and the goal of decentralization has always been to move away from a single point of authority, and to capitalize on and encourage the potential that has gathered in our community. Hive is drawing on the huge range of talent in our ecosystem to accelerate development, improve communication, and return to a focus on ease of use, onboarding, and marketing. The desire to move towards better decentralization and to connect people via blockchain has never been lost, and it's what makes Hive so needed now.\n<br>\n\n## What happens when Hive launches?\nWhen The Hive blockchain launches, existing Steem accounts will appear on the Hive Network as well. You will have two accounts: the current one on the Steem, and a new Hive account, which will be pre-populated with all of your current Steem content and information. \n\nThe history of these two accounts will be the same, but from the snapshot point onward, the accounts will be independent from one another. Actions you take on one network will not be reflected on the other. This means that future content and transactions will belong to whichever account you use. \n\n#### If you post on Hive, ***it will not show up*** on Steem, and vice versa. The two chains will be completely independent of one another after launch. \n<br>\n\n## When will Hive launch?\n**The Hive blockchain launch will be at 10am EST/14:00 UTC, Friday, March 20th.** (*countdown at https://hive.io/*) All of the magic will happen this week! The snapshot and airdrop will take place back to back at the time of launch. \n<br>\n\n## Where can I find Hive's code?\nHere is the public open source repo for Hive:\n### https://github.com/openhive-network/hive/releases\n<br>\n## As a STEEM  holder, what do I get in the Hive airdrop?\nAll valid STEEM stakeholders will receive a perfectly mirrored balance of their current STEEM holdings in the new HIVE coin. This will include matching amounts of current liquid STEEM, Steem Power, and SBD. All other account state data, such as claimed accounts, delegations, etc. will be mirrored onto Hive.\n\nFor example: if your Steem account has 10 STEEM, 5 SBD, and 1000 SP, your new Hive account will have 10 HIVE, 5 HBD, and 1000 HP.\n\n**You will not need to claim anything.** Simply log in with your existing Steem account details and you will have your new HIVE coins in your wallet and be able to start using the blockchain.\n\n#### The Hive airdrop will *only* be performed on the current version of the Steem blockchain (as of the date of this post). Any \"emergency hardforks\" performed prior to the airdrop will not be eligible. Further, any exchange that participates in such a hardfork prior to the airdrop date will null and void the ability to participate in the airdrop for its off-chain balance holding customers.\n<br>\n\n## How do I access my Hive account to post content and send Hive coins?\nYou can access your Hive account by simply logging in on the Hive Network using your existing Steem account keys. The first frontend available will be https://hive.blog. This is currently pointed at the Steem blockchain, but will be switched to Hive at launch time. Other popular interfaces are completing the switch over to Hive or finishing new products, and will be announcing when they are ready to use!\n<br>\n\n## Who is behind the development of Hive?\nThere are currently over 30 experienced developers contributing to the new ecosystem, alongside many committed community members working on multiple aspects of Hive. These individuals may announce their participation through their own accounts in the future. This a true community effort, and therefore is open to all. ***Hive will remain open source, and open to everyone who wants to contribute to the future development of the blockchain.*** Testnet will be available after this post is published, so feel free to comment here if you would like to access and we'll reach out. The full codebase will move to a public repo on Thursday, March 19th, prior to launch. *Updates will be made to this post and via this account.*\n<br>\n\n## What improvements have been added?\nThe most important improvements and decisions will be made after initial launch with a chance for proper feedback from the community. To successfully launch, there are some aspects that needed to be addressed immediately, including prevention of exchanges from participating in governance attacks (as we witnessed on the Steem Blockchain).\n\nTo prevent governance (or funding) attacks, a 30 day delay has been added on crediting vests towards witness and SPS votes. Further governance changes will need to be developed alongside the community.\n\nThis delay means that after an account “powers up” or stakes funds, there will be a 30 day delay before those vests can be used towards voting on governance (witnesses) or through voting in the SPS. For all other actions, there is no delay and vests are immediately available.\n\nThis is an initial way for us to mitigate this risk while continuing to improve the system as a whole, and without deciding on governance changes before returning to collection of wider community input. \n<br>\n\n## Will all Steem accounts be included in the HIVE airdrop?\nThe goal of Hive is to continue moving towards true decentralization, and therefore the launch airdrop will include all accounts who have showcased these same values and shared goals. \n\nThe only accounts who will not be included in the initial airdrop are those containing the Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake, and those who actively contributed to (and publicly declared support for) the centralization of the Steem Blockchain. \n\nThese accounts can still choose to take part in the new chain and their accounts will exist, but they will not be included in the intial airdrop.\n<br>\n\n## ***Important notes for cryptocurrency exchanges that list STEEM***\n#### Do you plan to support the Hive airdrop by taking a snapshot of your customer’s Steem holdings at the time of the airdrop and credit them with a similar amount of Hive (Yes/No)?\n**YES**) If you DO want to participate in the airdrop, please notify the Hive team that your exchange will distribute the airdrop on a pro-rata basis to your Steem customers (no fixed timeline for distribution is required), and the Hive account that corresponds to your Steem account will receive the airdrop at the time of the launch of Hive.\n\n**NO**) If you DO NOT want to participate in the airdrop, please send out a notification to your Steem-holding users to forewarn them that you will not be participating, so that they can temporarily withdraw their Steem from your exchange before the airdrop snapshot date, if they wish to participate in the Hive airdrop.\n\nIf at all possible, please let us know by **Thursday, March 19** if you will or will not be participating in the airdrop.\n\nYou can notify us by leaving a message on this post using your official Steem account, or you can contact one of our exchange liaisons:\n- **Gandalf (located in Europe)**\n*telegram*: @Gandalf_the_Grey\n*email*: gandalf@hive.expert \n- **David Jefferys (located in US)**\n*telegram*: @djefferys\n\nDirect follow-ups will be made, but if we do not receive an affirmative response by days end Thursday, March 19th, we will assume that your exchange doesn’t wish to participate in the airdrop for holding customer balances.\n\n# We're looking forward to the launch of Hive!\nThere's a lot to come during this extremely busy week, and this post and account will be updated to reflect new information as it becomes available.\n### Thank you for the spirit of community, and for being a part of the buzz. Looking forward to what's ahead for everyone who wants to get involved... #hiveisalive! \n\n# https://hive.io/\n\n",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible.

Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available.

Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive?

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words.

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote.

Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive?

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

Honey is a great reason, as there is nothing that beats your own homemade honey, but there are other things the bees also produce. For example, they produce beeswax, which you can use to make your own candles and beauty products. Pollination is also a good reason to have bees, as if you have a small garden it can produce lots of products due to the large amount of bees that will pollinate it. A final reason to do some beekeeping is that bees are very independent, and do not require a lot of maintenance. However, there are a few cons to look into as well. The first, and most major one is probably the fact that bees can sting. Another issue is the cost of supplies, and sometimes when beekeeping, the first year does not go very well.\n\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2013/08/07/20/13/bee-170551_960_720.jpg\n\nSo, let's get started! But before we do that, make sure that you check the local laws. Some places do not allow beekeeping. Also, know that bees take the quickest path from one location to another, known as a beeline, and that they may defecate in midair. When choosing a place to put a hive, try to make it in an open space, and let it get a little bit of sunlight (not too much). The best place to put a hive is in a sheltered area, not a hilltop as those are too windy. As you may know, nectar comes from different kinds of flowers. In fact, honey may taste very different depending on which kinds of flowers are the main source for the nectar that the bees bring back to the hive. Be careful about pesticides, as they can kill bees, and if they don't initially and the bee brings it back it can kill other bees or even the queen bee.\n\nhttp://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/d6/images/bee-clothing.jpeg\n\nThere is quite a bit of equipment that you will need to start beekeeping. The first major piece of equipment is beekeeping clothing. You need to have proper protection from the bees, or else you may get stung. Generally, for a beginner, a veil is important, along with sting proof gloves and sting proof clothing that covers your entire body. Other than the hive, which I will discuss later, you will need something called a smoker, which produces smoke and help the bees calm down. You will also need something called a hive tool, which is used to loosen the frames and the boxes that bees are in. One of the last tools you will need is something called the uncapping knife, which is used uncap wax cells where the honey is stored. There are plenty of places that you can go to to purchase beekeeping equipment.\n\nAnother thing to consider before buying the bees themselves is a hive. The most common hive for beginners is a hive that uses the Langstroth method.\nhttp://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/d6/images/langstrothHiveIllus.gif\nYou don't really need to worry about how to exactly build it though, as there are many kits for sale that are under $150. There are a few things to consider about the exact location of the hive. One important one is that it can be warmed by the morning sun. It should also be sheltered from the wind. A beehive needs to be near a source of water, as bees also need to drink. The beehive should be painted white or black, depending on where you live, but never with a toxic paint. To prevent bees from being a nuisance, there should be a fence around nearby street locations so that the bees fly over it.\n\nhttps://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/04/14/14/18/silk-bee-1328961_960_720.jpg\n\nAfter you have built a beehive, you will need to find some bees. Bees are very social creatures, and that is why it is important to know the basics of bee society. There are three main levels of bees: the worker, the drone, and the queen. Worker bees are females and are responsible for things like tending to the hive, its queen, guarding the hive's entrance, and collecting food. Drones are the males, and the only thing they need to do is mate with the queen. The queen herself is responsible for the genetic traits found withing a colony. To get bees, you can go through the wild and search for clusters of bees called swarms. If these swarms are on a tree limb, it is best to cut the entire limb and gently shake the bees into a container. Bees on a flat surface can be guided with a piece of cardboard, or some smoke behind them. However, by getting these bees for free, they may have certain diseases or have poor genetic material, resulting in weak bees. You should also be careful with regards to property laws, as taking a beehive on someone else's property may be considered stealing.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFqrbPdZuTA/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nThere are two main ways in which you can buy bees, which are in a package or a nucleus. The package method comes stocked with some worker bees, a queen bee, and some sweet syrup for the bees to eat out of. Here is where you make an important decision: How to introduce the bees to the queen. There are two main methods, the indirect method and the direct method. In the indirect method, the bees eat their way through food to get to the queen and slowly get used to her. This method is safer but may take longer. The direct method is to let out the queen bee directly into the hive, but the bees may attack her and destroy the hive. However, if the bees do not attack her, or the queen survives the attack, it may be faster than the indirect method, but it is also more risky. The other kind of thing that you can buy is a nucleus, which is already a small, fully functioning hive. You may, however, run into the fact that the queen is a weak or old queen, resulting in poor honey production and weak bees.\n\nhttps://www.farminguk.com/images/News/20600_1.jpg\n\nBefore you can start harvesting the liquid-gold that bees make, you need to know about some diseases that bees can catch. Here are the most common ones: Varroa Mites, which are parasites that attack both the larvae and adult bees. A medicine called Apistan appears to work well on them. Foulbrood is a virus that can deform and kill sealed broods of honeybees. CCD, or colony collapse disorder, is when bees just start leaving the hive. There is no cure for it, but some researchers have found that it is caused by both of fungus and a certain virus being present. When winter comes, you may want to wrap up your beehive, but make sure that the bees are not literally trapped in the hive.\n\nhttps://zeebeeman.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/honey-harvest.jpg\n\nSo, now you have the bees, which means that you have honey. Before you start harvesting honey by yourself, it is recommended that you go out with an expert for a few times to get the hang of it. Generally, there is a basic process of collecting honey. You need to make sure that you use small, gentle movement instead of large ones when collecting honey. The first step is get the bees off of the supers (a special layer in the bee hive). Try not to use smoke, as this may affect the taste of the honey. The next step is to remove the supers, and get the honey out of them. This can be done by uncapping the wax on the combs, or by purchasing a special extractor or centrifuge to make it easier. After this is done, you should strain the honey through cheesecloth to remove excess wax. Keep the honey in a settling tank to allow air bubbles to go up and bring foreign object with them, making those objects easier to remove. Then, you will need to skim off the foam. After you figure out which temperature you can store the honey at, you can start bottling it and then start selling it!\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial.

Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less.

You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post.

The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote.

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible.

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

As we celebrate our 5th anniversary as Hive and are approaching a decade as a community we continue to push the boundaries of blockchain possibilities and technical excellence. Over the years through dedication, ingenuity and perseverance, the Hive community has built a true beacon of Web3. The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote. Tag them. Every correct guess will get **1 Raffle Ticket**. But choose wisely, its 1 guess per person!*\n\n![Five_Years_Hive_Card.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ1ZApmrTG6DGmbEPW48uX2oWQdJxj6Ky7bQL5a5zNH24/Five_Years_Hive_Card.png)\n<sup>*Active accounts and accounts rewarded figures are based on partial estimates due to queries.*</sup>\n\n## Hive Changes Lives\nHive has consistently remained resilient despite being faced first with COVID-related challenges and then a highly-volatile market, which still persists. Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",

The Hive ecosystem is a vibrant embodiment of decentralization and accessibility and it is all of us here on Hive who have collectively made it happen. \n\nOn this special day even the Hive Whale has come out of hibernation after a chilly winter! https://hivewhale.com/ \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNf7kJ3n7gtB4NACuzCurrJQATD7N98dsW4BZNevUyVYx/image.png)\n\n## Collect Raffle Tickets & Win! 🎟️🎟️🎟️\nTo help mark this special occasion there are mini-contests throughout this post. Participate in them to collect Raffle Tickets. Each ticket gets you one entry in the Hive5 Raffle which will take place LIVE at Talent Land Mexico. The prize pool is **500 HBD**, divided between 5 lucky winners plus more mystery prizes. Entries for this round are due within 7 days so act fast!\n\n## Revolutionary Web3\n\nHive was created out of the love for decentralization and digital freedom. Unlike its competitors, Hive was never about the money. Hive is all about the vision. About true Web3. \n\nAll of us take special pride in Hive. Hive is built by its users for its users with no corporate influence. It rose out of the flames of an unprecedented attack on decentralization and open source principles and has from that time vowed to champion those key tenets and ensure that corporate greed has no place in its segment of Web3. The Hive community was not for sale five years ago and it never will be. No single entity has control of Hive -- it is decentralized, auditable, transparent, and barrier-less. It is a beacon of creativity, innovation and endurance among the greater blockchain-based technologies landscape and the cryptosphere. Its ecosystem has flourished organically, with myriad dapps, services and solutions for every need, from sharing videos to buying dinner.\n\nHive is built to last. Growth on Hive has never been about financial gains but always about exploring new opportunities to pursue innovation and build the best Web3 experience possible. Integrations, partnerships and onboarding all constitute the key milestones required to promote mass adoption. Not only do they allow new users to discover Hive but they also provide a gateway into data ownership and personal freedom and actualization.\n\n> “Hive makes an escape route possible,” wrote one Hive community member. “Not just from being an early adopter, but also because you can earn it by participating in the game. You make a post, you might get some HIVE. Once you have some Hive Power, you can vote that power and earn HIVE. This is what makes Hive different than most any of the other cryptos on offer, distribution is built into the first layer. You don't need a rack of servers or 4 digit electric bills to mine some hive, just something to say, the ability to type it out, and some networking for friends.”\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*Guess which Hiver wrote this quote.

Despite this, it is listed on over 40 exchanges and both HBD and HIVE are used as currency for B2B and B2C transactions worldwide. Hive has come from wondering what can be done with it in terms of use-cases to being welcomed in everything from grocery stores to entertainment venues to real-estate as the preferred cryptocurrency. Purchases can already be made without delay with only a phone with the help of the Hive Keychain and Distriator and now Hive Debit Cards are becoming available. The Virtual Smart Chain (VSC) is also currently in the final stages just edging towards launch, making integrations even more seamless.\n\nHive brought tangible change to the world. Freedom of expression is a universal human right along with an adequate standard of living. The Hive community does not wait for change to happen; it makes change happen. Hive community members brought water to remote villages in Ghana, Venezuela and Nigeria. In Ghana, the twentieth well is presently being constructed. Ordinary people who had no understanding of the true capabilities of blockchain technology and parallel economies are seeing their effects when their own neighbors have successfully used Hive to resolve problems in weeks that the local governments failed to tackle over decades.\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What’s your favorite Hive project? We invite you to celebrate by writing a post about it. Every post of a minimum 1,000 words will get **10 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\n## Feeless and Limitless\nHive is currently positioned as one of the most accessible blockchains to develop on. It makes development simple and fast. It has been transformed from the baseline DPoS blockchain technology it started out as into a light-weight solution suitable for any project or industry application. It did this while improving on security mechanisms to ensure that data integrity and decentralization remain paramount. \n\nHive has not only improved on existing DPoS technology but has made it truly limitless by crafting an extensive layer-2 capability and supporting cross-chain integrations. The HAF API Note Suite now bundles together the innovative Hive Application Framework (HAF) with HAF Account History (HAFAH), Hived (core protocol), Hivemind, a block explorer and more. While Hive sports 3 second blocks, its one block irreversibility (OBI) means that confirmation is near-instant, making transactions final without any waiting. Every part of Hive has been continuously optimized to limit the required resources in relation to all types of transactions and to lower the infrastructure requirements to run the most complex of operations. Everything is designed for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZjJcHu7K9ZusxswhSJ1X36Bc3D3FgiJ3kZJxG1SqsiDs/image.png)\n\n\n#### 🎟️ Contest!\n*What types of innovative ideas would you like to see on Hive? Write a post and link it in the comments below describing your desired idea in 400-500 words. Every post that fits the brief will get **5 Raffle Tickets**.*\n\nChanges are happening and changes are also sought after here on Hive too. We look forward to the next five years as we make those changes and pave new roads through Web3. Hive on!",
