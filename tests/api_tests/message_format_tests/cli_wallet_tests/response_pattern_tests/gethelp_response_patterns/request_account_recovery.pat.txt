this command contains a serialized authority object so there is an example
below on how to pass in the authority.

request_account_recovery "your_account" "account_to_recover"
{"weight_threshold": 1,"account_auths": [], "key_auths":
[["new_public_key",1]]} true

Parameters:

    account_to_recover: The name of the account you are trying to recover
	(type: const string &)
    new_authority: The new owner authority for the recovered account. This
	should be given to you by the holder of the compromised or lost
