Lists all accounts registered in the blockchain.

Use the 'lowerbound' and limit parameters to page through the list. To
retrieve all accounts, start by setting 'lowerbound' to the empty string
'""', and then each iteration, pass the last account name returned as the
'lowerbound' for the next 'list_accounts()' call.

Parameters:
    lowerbound: the name of the first account to return. If the named
	account does not exist, the list will start at the account that
	comes after 'lowerbound' (type: const string &)
    limit: the maximum number of accounts to return (max: 1000) (type:
	uint32_t)
