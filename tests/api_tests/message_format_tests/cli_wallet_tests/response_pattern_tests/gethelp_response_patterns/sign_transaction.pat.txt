Signs a transaction.

Given a fully-formed transaction that is only lacking signatures, this
signs the transaction with the necessary keys and optionally broadcasts the
transaction

Parameters:
    tx: the unsigned transaction (type: const
	wallet_serializer_wrapper<annotated_signed_transaction_ex> &)
    broadcast: true if you wish to broadcast the transaction (type: bool)
