This method is used by faucets to create new accounts for other users which
must provide their desired keys. The resulting account may not be
controllable by this wallet. There is a fee associated with account
creation that is paid by the creator. The current account creation fee can
be found with the 'info' wallet command. This method is identical to
'create_account_with_keys' except that it also adds a 'transfer' operation
to the transaction after the create.

Parameters:
    creator: The account creating the new account (type: const string &)
    new_account_name: The name of the new account (type: const string &)
    initial_amount: The amount transferred to the account (type: const
	wallet_serializer_wrapper<hive::protocol::asset> &)
    memo: A memo to send with the transfer (type: const string &)
    json_meta: JSON Metadata associated with the new account (type: const
	string &)
    owner_key: public owner key of the new account (type: public_key_type)
    active_key: public active key of the new account (type:
	public_key_type)
    posting_key: public posting key of the new account (type:
	public_key_type)
    memo_key: public memo key of the new account (type: public_key_type)
