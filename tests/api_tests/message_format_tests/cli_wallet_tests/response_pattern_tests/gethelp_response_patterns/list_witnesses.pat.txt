Lists all witnesses registered in the blockchain.

This returns a list of all account names registered as witnesses sorted by
name. This lists witnesses whether they are currently enabled, voted in or
not.

Use the 'lowerbound' and limit parameters to page through the list. To
retrieve all witnesss, start by setting 'lowerbound' to the empty string
'""', and then each iteration, pass the last witness name returned as the
'lowerbound' for the next 'list_witnesss' call.

Parameters:
    lowerbound: the name of the first witness to return. If the named
	witness does not exist, the list will start at the witness that
	comes after 'lowerbound' (type: const string &)
    limit: the maximum number of witnesss to return (max: 1000) (type:
	uint32_t)
