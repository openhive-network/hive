Statewide, around 1,200 hives have been taken this year. &nbsp;The thefts have prompted the formation of a multi-state &nbsp;task force and have hurt some smaller bee operations enough that some &nbsp;are considering quitting what had once been been viable honey and &nbsp;pollination operations. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dadant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2016/08/ABJ-Extra-Aug24-2016.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.dadant.com/news/nutrition-matters-stress-from-migratory-beekeeping-may-be-eased-by-access-to-food\">Nutrition Matters: Stress From Migratory Beekeeping May Be Eased by Access to Food</a></h1>\n<p><em><strong>24 August 2016 -</strong></em> &nbsp;In the first large-scale and comprehensive study on the impacts of &nbsp;transporting honey bees to pollinate various crops, research from North &nbsp;Carolina State University shows that travel can adversely affect bee &nbsp;health and lifespan. Some of these negative impacts may be reduced by &nbsp;moving bee colonies into patches with readily available food or by &nbsp;providing supplemental nutrition when there are few flowers for honey &nbsp;bees to visit, the researchers say. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://roypchel.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pchelovodstvo-450x333.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"333\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://steemit.com/beekeeper/@kental/the-answers-to-the-main-questions-for-the-beginners-beekeepers-bees\">The answers to the main questions for the beginners beekeepers!

He is a bee keeper. &nbsp;I have never been to a bee farm before, because I'm afraid of bees. But &nbsp;yesterday I thought that it is a high time to overcome my fear. When I &nbsp;came up to a beehive, I was amazed to watch these small noisy creatures. &nbsp;They were busy doing their duties and paid no attention to me. And my &nbsp;boyfriend told me that a bee's character (I mean whether it is &nbsp;aggressive or not) depends on its breed.

There is a lot of information being disseminated by health organizations about health risks to humans from mosquito bites (<em>see</em> &nbsp;CDC links, below). But besides protecting ourselves from being targets, &nbsp;we need to work at eliminating mosquito&nbsp;habitat and controlling&nbsp;their &nbsp;numbers. There are a number of ways we can do this safely and &nbsp;effectively. Because mosquitoes have no trouble flying from yard to yard, the best &nbsp;way to combat them is to work with our neighbors to collectively &nbsp;identify and implement opportunities to reduce mosquito populations. &nbsp;Below is&nbsp;a set of approaches that are suggested by entomologists, public &nbsp;health organizations, and agricultural extension programs.&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",
