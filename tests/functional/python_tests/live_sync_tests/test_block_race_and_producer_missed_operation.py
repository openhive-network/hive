    The test involves a network with 21 witnesses, out of which 4 have their time set to the current time plus 4 seconds.
    This causes these witnesses to produce their blocks too early, resulting in a "race" with witnesses who produce blocks
    according to the schedule. As a result, there are situations where an incorrect block enters the chain and is accepted
    by other witnesses. In this scenario, the block from the correct witness is lost, and the witness receives a virtual
    operation called "producer_missed_operation".
