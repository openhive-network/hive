    By default, the maximum recurrence time to execute all sent recurrent transfers is 2 years (730 days).
    Because the first execution happens instantly on new recurrent transfer, the maximum is 730 days with two executions.
    The edge case for new recurrent transfer is recurrence = MAX_RECURRENT_TRANSFER_END_DATE * 24 / (executions - 1)
    which is still valid (exactly 730 days).
    It becomes more complicated with edits of existing recurrent transfer, because first execution after
    edit happens on previous schedule or after recurrence time when that parameter is changed, but the idea
    is the same - last transfer has to be scheduled for execution not further into the future than 2 years.

    If the maximum is exceeded, the exception 'Cannot set a transfer that would last for longer than 730 days' is thrown.
