Lists direct RC delegations from specified delegator to its delegatees.

Results are ordered ascending by delegatee' ids. Note, that results are not
ordered alphabetically, like in other API methods starting with list_
prefix.

Delegations are listed starting from specified delegatee or, if there is no
delegations to specified delegatee, from first delegatee whose id is
higher.

To list delegations from the beginning, delegatee can be specified as empty
string.

Parameters:
    start: Specifies delegator and first delegatee to list. It is array
	with two strings, where 0-th element is delegator name and 1-st
	element is first delegatee name. (type: fc::variant)
    limit: Maximum number of returned delegations. (type: uint32_t)
