Returns an uninitialized object representing a given blockchain operation.

This returns a default-initialized object of the given type; it can be used
during early development of the wallet when we don't yet have custom
commands for creating all of the operations the blockchain supports.

Any operation the blockchain supports can be created using the transaction
builder's 'add_operation_to_builder_transaction()' , but to do that from
the CLI you need to know what the JSON form of the operation looks like.
This will give you a template you can fill in. It's better than nothing.

Parameters:
    operation_type: the type of operation to return, must be one of the
	operations defined in 'hive/chain/operations.hpp' (e.g.,
	"global_parameters_update_operation") (type: const string &)
