Transforms a brain key to reduce the chance of errors when re-entering the
key from memory.

This takes a user-supplied brain key and normalizes it into the form used
for generating private keys. In particular, this upper-cases all ASCII
characters and collapses multiple spaces into one.

Parameters:
    s: the brain key as supplied by the user (type: string)
