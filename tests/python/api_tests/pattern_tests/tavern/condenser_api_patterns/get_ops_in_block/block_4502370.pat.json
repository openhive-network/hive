Statewide, around 1,200 hives have been taken this year. &nbsp;The thefts have prompted the formation of a multi-state &nbsp;task force and have hurt some smaller bee operations enough that some &nbsp;are considering quitting what had once been been viable honey and &nbsp;pollination operations. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dadant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2016/08/ABJ-Extra-Aug24-2016.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.dadant.com/news/nutrition-matters-stress-from-migratory-beekeeping-may-be-eased-by-access-to-food\">Nutrition Matters: Stress From Migratory Beekeeping May Be Eased by Access to Food</a></h1>\n<p><em><strong>24 August 2016 -</strong></em> &nbsp;In the first large-scale and comprehensive study on the impacts of &nbsp;transporting honey bees to pollinate various crops, research from North &nbsp;Carolina State University shows that travel can adversely affect bee &nbsp;health and lifespan. Some of these negative impacts may be reduced by &nbsp;moving bee colonies into patches with readily available food or by &nbsp;providing supplemental nutrition when there are few flowers for honey &nbsp;bees to visit, the researchers say. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://roypchel.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pchelovodstvo-450x333.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"333\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://steemit.com/beekeeper/@kental/the-answers-to-the-main-questions-for-the-beginners-beekeepers-bees\">The answers to the main questions for the beginners beekeepers!

He is a bee keeper. &nbsp;I have never been to a bee farm before, because I'm afraid of bees. But &nbsp;yesterday I thought that it is a high time to overcome my fear. When I &nbsp;came up to a beehive, I was amazed to watch these small noisy creatures. &nbsp;They were busy doing their duties and paid no attention to me. And my &nbsp;boyfriend told me that a bee's character (I mean whether it is &nbsp;aggressive or not) depends on its breed. His bees are kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i67.tinypic.com/2aj6tjb.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@englishtchrivy/steemitphotochallenge-entry-macro-photography-bees-upclose-and-personal\">SteemitPhotoChallenge Entry Macro Photography : BEES - upclose and personal</a></h1>\n<p><em><strong>15 Aug 2016 - </strong></em>&nbsp;This is my entry, I posted it pretty early not knowing that the photo &nbsp;challenge is actually held on weekends and that there are things you &nbsp;have to have on your post to make it qualify. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>[More and larger photos in the article]</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i63.tinypic.com/30sik4l.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@englishtchrivy/smartphone-photography-bee-a-fingernail-close\">SMARTPHONE PHOTOGRAPHY : \" BEE A Fingernail Close ;)</a></h1>\n<p><em><strong>&nbsp;8 August 2016 - </strong></em>2 days ago, after 17:00, in my garden ...<br>\nWas having a break, was having &nbsp;a BEE moment ^ ^ ...<br>\nThey were there - just sitting and nipping a while<br>\nin that wonderful world of nectar haven of a passion flower &nbsp;~<br>\nand then there were three ...<br>\nHow lucky can I BEE :D to get this pretty close to such cute little BEES ?<br>\nThanks be to God for them BEES ^ ^.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>[More and larger photos in the article]</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i65.tinypic.com/j7ahe9.jpg\" width=\"1598\" height=\"847\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@englishtchrivy/smartphone-photography-tips-on-how-to-capture-a-honey-bee-in-action\">SMARTPHONE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS on How to Capture a Honey Bee in Action</a></h1>\n<p>7 August 2016 - &nbsp;Have you ever tried taking a picture of a honeybee in action using just your smartphone's camera? &nbsp;Yes! &nbsp;It is P O S S I B L E! &nbsp;If you've read my very first post about taking a picture of a hoverfly &nbsp;using just your smartphone camera, too then you know what my first tip &nbsp;is going to be. &nbsp;Honey bees are pretty friendly. &nbsp;You must know that like us warriors, &nbsp;they are very busy fulfilling their maximum potentials since their wings &nbsp;normally just last two - weeks the longest &nbsp;before they get worn out. &nbsp;&nbsp;This guy just went on nipping nectar while I kept pressing my shutter - &nbsp;off &nbsp;- Samsung galaxy A3 2016 edition phone's camera.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>[More and larger photos in the article]</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://arlingtonmasternaturalists.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/aedes-aegypti-from-wikipedia.jpg?w=700&amp;h=475\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\"/></p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://armn.org/2016/02/19/how-to-control-mosquitoes-without-killing-pollinators-and-other-important-wildlife/\">How to Control Mosquitoes Without Killing Pollinators and Other Important&nbsp;Wildlife</a></h1>\n<p><em><strong>9 February 2016 - </strong></em>&nbsp;Warm weather and mosquitoes will be here before you know it, leading &nbsp;many of us to look for ways to enjoy the outdoors without being pestered &nbsp;by those annoying little\u2014and sometimes disease-bearing\u2014biters. There is a lot of information being disseminated by health organizations about health risks to humans from mosquito bites (<em>see</em> &nbsp;CDC links, below). But besides protecting ourselves from being targets, &nbsp;we need to work at eliminating mosquito&nbsp;habitat and controlling&nbsp;their &nbsp;numbers. There are a number of ways we can do this safely and &nbsp;effectively. Because mosquitoes have no trouble flying from yard to yard, the best &nbsp;way to combat them is to work with our neighbors to collectively &nbsp;identify and implement opportunities to reduce mosquito populations. &nbsp;Below is&nbsp;a set of approaches that are suggested by entomologists, public &nbsp;health organizations, and agricultural extension programs.&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",
