# Hive - Decentralizing the exchange of ideas and information

![Hive](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/netuoso/jMHldwMV-horizontal.png)

Hive is a Graphene based, social blockchain that was created as a fork of Steem and born on the core idea of decentralization. Originally, Hive was announced on the [Steem blockchain](https://peakd.com/communityfork/@hiveio/announcing-the-launch-of-hive-blockchain) prior to the initial token airdrop. Hive did not have any ICO or mining period.

The Hive blockchain removes the elements of centralization and imbalanced control that have plagued the Steem blockchain over the last 4 years. Since itâ€™s launch on March 20, 2020 Hive is growing and evolving day by day. Hive's prime selling points are its decentralization, 3 second transaction speed and ability to handle large volumes. It is ideal real estate for a variety of innovative projects focused on a broad range of fields, from open source development to games.

Hive serves as the operational home for all kinds of projects, companies, and applications. Having a highly active and passionate community, Hive has become a thriving atmosphere for new and experienced developers to quickly bootstrap their applications. On top of this, Hive is extremely rewarding to content creators and curators alike.

Hive aims to be the preferred blockchain for dApp development with Smart Media Tokens at its core. With SMTs, everyone can leverage the power of Hive.

The technical development of the Hive blockchain itself is carried out by the founding decentralized group of over 30 open source developers, many of whom were instrumental in creating Steem back in 2016, and supported by a growing community of additional open source developers and witnesses.

# Installation

Getting started with Hive is fairly simple. You can either choose to use docker-images, build with docker manually or build from source directly. All steps have been documented and while many different OS are supported, the easiest one is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

## Quickstart

Just want to get up and running quickly? We have pre-built Docker images for your convenience. More details are in our [Quickstart Guide](doc/exchangequickstart.md).

## Building

We **strongly** recommend using one of our pre-built Docker images or using Docker to build Hive. Both of these processes are described in the [Quickstart Guide](doc/exchangequickstart.md).

But if you would still like to build from source, we also have [build instructions](doc/building.md) for Linux (Ubuntu LTS).

## Dockerized deployment

Building a docker image is described here: [Building under Docker](doc/building.md#building-under-docker)

If you'd like to use our already pre-built official binary images, it's as simple as downloading it from the Dockerhub registry with only one command:

```
docker pull hiveio/hive
```

To run a Hive consensus node there are needed resources:
- data directory to hold a blockchain file(s) (ca 400GB is required)
- storage to hold a shared memory file (ca. 24GB of memory is required at the moment to store state data):

There is provided a script wrapping `docker run` statement and emulating direct hived usage: [run_hived_img.sh](scripts/run_hived_img.sh)

General usage: `run_hived_img.sh <docker_img> [OPTION[=VALUE]]... [<hived_option>]...`

Read [more about using run_hived_img.sh](doc/run_hived_img.md) in various scenarios.

## CLI Wallet

We provide a basic cli wallet for interfacing with `hived`. The wallet is self-documented via command line help. The node you connect to via the cli wallet needs to be running the `account_by_key_api`, `condenser_api`, `database_api`, `account_history_api`, `wallet_bridge_api` and needs to be configured to accept WebSocket connections via `webserver-ws-endpoint`.

cli_wallet tool offers two operating modes:
- interactive, when given commands are executed in interactive command line
- daemon based, where it is possible to execute wallet commands using RPC calls. It is important to specify also an IP set, which are allowed to establish connections to the wallet HTTP server. See `--rpc-http-endpoint`, `--daemon`, `--rpc-http-allowip` options for details

To prepare transactions, you need to execute few setup steps in cli_wallet:
- use set_password <password> call establish a password protecting your wallet from unauthorized access
- use unlock <password> to turn full-operation mode in the wallet
- import private key(s) using import_key "WIF-key" command

Keys and password are stored in the wallet.json file.

## Testing

See [doc/devs/testing.md](doc/devs/testing.md) for test build targets and info
on how to use lcov to check code test coverage.

# Configuration

## Config File

Run `hived` once to generate a data directory and config file. The default data directory location is `~/.hived`. Kill `hived`. If you want to modify the config to your liking, we have [example config](contrib/config-for-docker.ini) used in the docker image. All options will be present in the default config file and there may be more options needing to be changed from the docker configs (some of the options actually used in images are configured via command line).

## Seed Nodes

A list of some seed nodes to get you started can be found in
[doc/seednodes.txt](doc/seednodes.txt).

This same file is baked into the docker images and can be overridden by
setting `HIVED_SEED_NODES` in the container environment at `docker run`
time to a whitespace delimited list of seed nodes (with port).
